        <div class="subheading mb-5">Psychology Major</div>
        <p class="lead mb-4">I am currently a senior psychology student at UCR working towards becoming a counselor. I started my educational career a year out of high school at Norco Community College. During this time I am also trying to establish myself as a working individual, and obtain my own income. After working several jobs and finishing my associates degree, I transfer to UCR and have a stable job I plan to commit to as my primary source of income. Currently, I am in my last year of my bachelor’s degree while maintaining my independence away from family. My plan for the future is to participate in research labs after I graduate, apply for graduate school, and hopefully soon after or by then will work somewhere relevant to my field of interest. The biggest challenge has been maintaining my life outside of school while still pursuing my dream.
<br><br>

        My educational career started around 2018 at Norco Community College. Even though I was doing my general education, I still loved it. I cannot help but enjoy myself when I am learning something; I may dread starting the process, but I always get lost in it when I do. That feeling grew much stronger when it would be human-related. I would say psychology related, but I also loved cultural anthropology, art, human biology, literature, history, etc. When considering another major, I knew deep down that psychology has my heart. I was getting A's and B's with the occasional C. If I remember right, my GPA was 3.3. 
<br><br>

        For better or worse, I took my time to get here. When I started, I wanted to be sure I did it right; I highly value my quality of work. I only took a few classes at a time. With the extra time, I was fulfilling obligations as a son/brother which gave me a much deeper appreciation for family that I had ever understood before. I truly had not realized the importance of a social circle. Coworkers and friends I talk to tell me all of the time how family or friends will help them with other responsibilities while they are working their primary or secondary job. Psychology was helping me conceptualize the thoughts, feelings, and experiences I was having. When I was having trouble focusing on my school work, I remembered learning about changing our environment to modify behavior. So I started doing the majority of my school work on campus, and I was significantly more efficient.
